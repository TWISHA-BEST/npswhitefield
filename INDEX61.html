The children were attired in the colors of the Indian flag and proudly wore badges of our flag carefully crafted by them. Some of them narrated how they celebrated the Independence Day by singing patriotic songs and making our national flag at home. They listened attentively to the story of our freedom movement and were enthralled by the puppet show they had seen. They actively participated in speaking about our national symbols and discussed the importance of freedom. They also were happy to see the surprise video sent by the Pre- Primary teachers which depicted the unity and diversity of our nation. The celebrations concluded with great pride saluting to our mother land. Jai Hind!
